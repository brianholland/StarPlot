#StarPlot

This repo is a short example of 

1. scraping the web, 
1. cleaning  data with Pandas and Python, and 
1. plotting the results in 3-D.

The example is the brighter stars within 50 light-years. The plot can be turned around 
interactively when it's run.  Speaking of which: run the code by downloading the Python
bit, and typing

```
python StarPlot.py
```

at the command line.  You'll have to be on the 'Net since it grabs the coordinates from 
 http://www.atlasoftheuniverse.com/50lys.html.  Also, please visit that page


The result looks like this - depending how you rotate it of course.
